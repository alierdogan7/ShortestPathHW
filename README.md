# ShortestPathHW

Using Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm, we are asked to find the shortest path between cities.

For only joy, I extended the given sample map to a full Turkey map. Now, it holds 81 cities and all the neighborhoods in it (it took a serious amount of time, tough.) The extended version is in the "turkey_map" folder.
Example output:

The shortest path from Edirne to Hakkari is 15 along cities and it's like below: 
Edirne
Kirklareli
Istanbul
Kocaeli
Sakarya
Bolu
Cankiri
Corum
Yozgat
Sivas
Erzincan
Erzurum
Agri
Van
Hakkari
